<h1>King of Kings</h1>
</section>
<section>
<p>In the darkness, we were waiting</p>
<p>Without hope, without light</p>
<p>'Til from Heaven You came running</p>
<p>There was mercy in Your eyes</p>
<p>To fulfill the law and prophets</p>
<p>To a virgin came the Word</p>
<p>From a throne of endless glory</p>
<p>To a cradle in the dirt</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>Praise the Father, praise the Son</p>
<p>Praise the Spirit, three in one</p>
<p>God of glory, Majesty</p>
<p>Praise forever to the King of Kings</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>To reveal the kingdom coming</p>
<p>And to reconcile the lost</p>
<p>To redeem the whole creation</p>
<p>You did not despise the cross</p>
<p>For even in Your suffering</p>
<p>You saw to the other side</p>
<p>Knowing this was our salvation</p>
<p>Jesus for our sake You died</p>

<p>Praise the Father, praise the Son</p>

<p>Praise forever to the King of Kings</p>

<section>
<p>And the morning that You rose</p>
<p>All of Heaven held its breath</p>
<p>'Til that stone was moved for good</p>
<p>For the Lamb had conquered death</p>
<p>And the dead rose from their tombs</p>
<p>And the angels stood in awe</p>
<p>For the souls of all who'd come</p>
<p>To the Father are restored</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>And the church of Christ was born</p>
<p>Then the Spirit lit the flame</p>
<p>Now this gospel truth of old</p>
<p>Shall not kneel, shall not faint</p>
<p>By His blood and in His name</p>
<p>In His freedom I am free</p>
<p>For the love of Jesus Christ</p>
<p>Who has resurrected me</p>
